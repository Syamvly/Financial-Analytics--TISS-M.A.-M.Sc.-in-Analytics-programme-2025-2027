**COURSE TITLE: Financial Analytics**

**Course Description**

This course introduces students to the principles and applications of financial analytics for decision-making under uncertainty. It integrates financial markets, portfolio theory, risk measurement, forecasting, derivatives, and optimization using real-world data and cases. Emphasis is placed on understanding risk, volatility, and market behaviour rather than pure prediction. The course culminates in an integrated case study reflecting professional financial analytics practice.

**Course Objectives**

1. To develop an analytical understanding of financial markets, risk, and uncertainty using data-driven approaches.

2. To equip students with tools for portfolio construction, risk measurement, forecasting, hedging, and optimization.

3. To enable informed financial decision-making through integrated case analysis and professional judgment.
